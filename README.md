# Degen Gaming ERC-20 Token README
### Introduction
Welcome to the README for the Degen Gaming ERC-20 token â€“ the heart of the Degen Gaming ecosystem on the Avalanche network. This document provides an overview of the smart contract's capabilities and usage.

### Token Details
Name: Degen
Symbol: DGN
## Functionality
### Minting Tokens
Authorized addresses are granted the power to mint new tokens. Minting involves the creation of fresh tokens, adding to the overall token supply. This feature facilitates the expansion of the token availability as required.

### Transferring Tokens
Token holders can seamlessly transfer tokens to other addresses using the transfer function. Senders need to specify the recipient's address along with the token amount. The transfer is subject to the sender's available token balance.

### Redeeming Tokens
Token holders can redeem their tokens for in-game rewards or other utilities within the Degen Gaming platform. The redeem function deducts the chosen token amount from the sender's balance and issues corresponding rewards.

### Checking Token Balance
Token holders can conveniently check their balance using the balanceOf function. By inputting an address, this function yields the associated token balance.

### Burning Tokens
Token holders possess the option to burn (destroy) their tokens, thereby decreasing the total token supply. The burn function deducts the specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance and adjusts the total supply accordingly.

### Deployment
The deployment of the Degen Gaming ERC-20 token smart contract will be carried out on the Avalanche network. The process entails interaction with Avalanche-compatible development tools and libraries.

### Security Considerations
To ensure the security of the ecosystem:

.Exercise strict control over authorized addresses for token minting.
.Implement robust access control mechanisms for sensitive functions.
.Conduct rigorous testing of the smart contract to identify vulnerabilities and address edge cases.
.Explore the use of multi-signature schemes for critical operations.
