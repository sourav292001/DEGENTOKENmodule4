# Degen Gaming ERC-20 Token

# Description

The Degen Gaming ERC-20 token is designed for in-game utility within the Degen Gaming ecosystem on the Avalanche network.

This README provides an overview of the smart contract's functionality.

# Token Details

 .Name: Degen

 .Symbol: DGN


# Functionality

## Minting  Tokens:

The smart contract allows authorized addresses to mint new tokens.
 
Minting is the process of creating new tokens and adding them to the total token supply.
 
This feature enables the expansion of the token supply as needed.

## Transferring Tokens:

Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses using the transfer function.

This function requires the sender to specify the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to be transferred.

Transfers are subject to available token balances.

## Redeeming Tokens:

The smart contract enables token holders to redeem their tokens for in-game rewards or other utility within the Degen Gaming platform.

The redeem function deducts the specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance and provides the corresponding rewards.

## Checking Token Balance:

Token holders can check their balance using the balanceOf function.
 
By providing an address as an argument, this function returns the current token balance associated with that address.

## Burning Tokens:

Token holders have the ability to burn (destroy) their tokens, reducing the total token supply.
The burn function deducts the specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance and decreases the total supply accordingly.

# Deployment:

The Degen Gaming ERC-20 token smart contract will be deployed on the Avalanche network. 

Deployment will involve interacting with Avalanche-compatible development tools and libraries.

# Security Considerations:

Ensure that only authorized addresses are allowed to mint new tokens.

Implement proper access control mechanisms for sensitive functions.

Thoroughly test the smart contract for vulnerabilities and edge cases.

Consider utilizing multi-signature schemes for critical operations.
